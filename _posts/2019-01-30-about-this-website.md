This website and blog is my attempt to discover and research the genealogy of **Mitchell Raymo** (1813–1892) of Nankin Township, Michigan. Mitchell was my great-great-great-grandfather, and before I started researching my own family history in 2010, I had never heard of the man.

It appears that Mitchell was the progenitor of the surname "Raymo" in North America, at least for my branch of the family. This uncommon surname is an anglicization of the French surname "Raymond" [and its variants "Raimond" and "Rémond"] that more closely matches the original [French pronunciation](https://youtu.be/g_2iBptkGDU).<sup>[1]</sup>

I have already done extensive research on Mitchell's ancestors and descendants, and will continue to do so for years to come. This website is intended to collect that research and present it in an easily digestible format for those who may be interested. It may also serve as a kind of ongoing research log, as well as a practical demonstration of many of the techniques and methodologies of professional genealogical research.

Like most family history research, it will be a work-in-progress. Even after ten years of research, I still discover new insights into the lives of my ancestors. New documents and sources are occasionally discovered, which necessitate renewed interpretation of events long past. History is never certain, and requires continual critical analysis to better understand the lives and times of those who came before us.

    <p class="footnote">
        <sup>1</sup> Trailing consonants are typically silent in French. It is presumed that for Mitchell and his French-Canadian family, lopping off the trailing <em>&ldquo;-nd&rdquo;</em> was preferable to the usual hard-consonant English pronunciation of Raymond.
