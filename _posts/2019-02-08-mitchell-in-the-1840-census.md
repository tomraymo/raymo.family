In 1840, Mitchell was enumerated in Nankin Township, Wayne County, Michigan under the name "Michael Raymo." That year's census began on June 1st, only weeks before the death of his wife Laura. The full enumeration of his household is as follows:<sup>[2]</sup>

We know from [Mitchell's bible record]({% post_url 2019-02-01-the-family-bible %}), that he was married with two young daughters by 1840, and that is what we see in this enumeration. The female aged 15–19 is unidentified. She could possibly be a younger relative of either Mitchell or Laura, or less likely, a household servant. Further research would be needed to suggest a more exact identification.

    <p class="footnote">
        <sup>1</sup> Mitchell would have been 17 years old in 1830 and unlikely to be a head of household at the time of that year&#146;s decennial census. Unsurprisingly, he is not enumerated in the 1830 U.S. Census by name.
