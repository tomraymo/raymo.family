To this point, I have not located any extant birth, marriage, or death records for Mitchell's first wife **Laura Perry** (ca. 1816–1840), other what has been passed down to us in the [Mitchell Raymo Family Bible](https://raymo.family/2019/02/01/the-family-bible.html). However, there is a grave marker for Laura in **Old Wayne Cemetery**, in Wayne, Michigan.<sup>[1]</sup> According the terrifically useful [Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11024528/laura-raymo) online database, the inscription on the marker for Laura indicates she was the wife of "Mitchel Raymo" and died on the 9th of July of an undetermined year. Although missing a death year on the marker, the death date exactly matches what was recorded in Mitchell's bible.

According to a [brochure](https://www.ci.wayne.mi.us/pdfs/old_wayne_cemetery_brochure.pdf) produced by the **City of Wayne Community Development Department**, Old Wayne Cemetery was in use from 1834 through its final burial in 1916. Laura's recorded death in 1840 is within this timespan. Additionally, the brochure also indicates that Laura's maiden name was "Drake," however the source and author of this assertion is unknown and I have not found any corroborating information to support this conclusion.<sup>[2]</sup>

When confronted by conflicting information, e.g. the maiden name of Laura, careful genealogists will more heavily weigh evidence that is from **Primary** (firsthand) sources of information rather than **Secondary** (secondhand) sources. In this example, Mitchell's bible is a Primary source. It is presumed that Mitchell knew what his wife's maiden name was, and recorded it accurately in his family bible. The brochure produced by an unknown researcher more than a century later is a Secondary source, and absent supporting documentation, has less value as evidence.
