In genealogy, primary sources are prized. These are documents and records that were created at or near the time of the event recorded, by people who were directly involved with the event. For example, a recording of a birth in a contemporary letter written by one of the parents carries far more evidentiary weight than the recollections of an uninvolved third-party decades later. Primary sources are often eye-witnesses to the events being researched, and their testimony is valued highly when piecing together an account of the past.

Births, marriages, and deaths recorded in family bibles are prime examples of primary sources.

Some time after I began researching the Raymo family history, I was informed of the existence of a family bible that was once owned by **Mitchell Raymo**, that is now in the possession of one of his many descendants. The current owner was kind enough to provide me with a transcription of the family history data recorded within it. This data directly answered many open questions I still had about the early life and family of Mitchell.

The relevant transcription is as follows:<sup>[1]</sup>

<pre class="text-center">
&ldquo;Mitchell Raymo
Was born february
the nineteenth the
    year 1813

I was married
January the first day
the year 1835
to Miss Laura Perry
She died July the 9<sup>th</sup>
the year 1840 age 24 years
    and 76 days

Elizabeth Raymo was
born november the 9<sup>th</sup>
the year 1835

Rhody ann Raymo was
born september the 23<sup>d</sup>
the year 1837.&rdquo;
</pre>

This bible records the marriage of Mitchell Raymo to his first wife Laura Perry when he was only 21 years old. It also records the birth of his first two children and the tragic early death of Laura, after only five years of marriage. 

The phrase <em>"I was married..."</em> implies that these accounts were recorded by Mitchell himself, which adds strength to their value as genealogical evidence.

In Michigan, where Mitchell was living at this time, consistent county registration of births, marriages, and deaths did not begin until 1867. In fact, Michigan did not even become a state until 1837. The events recorded in this bible are from a time when the Michigan Territory was a frontier of the still young United States.

The information for Laura Perry in particular, specifically her maiden name and date of marriage, I have not found recorded anywhere else. If not for the handing down and preservation of this family bible record, her identity may have been lost forever.
